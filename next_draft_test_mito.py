## "All binding interactions are reversible and equilibria are governed by local affinities.
## Interactions with the lipid bilayer hange the affinities of the interactions and
### therefore have an active role in the functions of the proteins.
## THE GOOD STUFF -- Binding of the activator BH3-only proteins (e.g. BID, BIM) to membranes
## increases their affinity for the pore-formers (e.g. BAX, BAK), which are activated (arrows)
## to permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane."
# (1)(a) pro-apoptotic (BH3-only), the activators, bind to membranes
#    (b) when BH3+ are bound to membrane, they are more likely to be bound to pore-formers (B++) BAX, BAK, BOK
#    (c) when B++ are bound to BH3+, B++ gain a MOM-permeability function, to also make pores
## COMPARTMENT - membrane
#  BH3+ (free)  <-->  BH3+:MOM
#  BH3+:MOM + B++  <-->   BH3+:MOM:B++ (high forward rate, noncovalent?)
#  BH3+:MOM:B++  -->  BH3+:MOM:B++  (covalent bond)
#  BH3+:MOM:B++  -->  BH3:MOM:B++ (pore-forming ability - B++)


##### (2)
## GOOD STUFF - parte 2 - "The anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. BCL-XL, BCL-2, MCL-1) inhibit both
## the activator BH3-only proteins and ..." by mutual sequestration
# (2)(a) anti-apoptotic (--L) bind to BH3+
#    (b) --L and BH3+ are held up from further action
#  --L + BH3+  <--> --L:BH3+  (reversible binding, noncovalent?)
#  --L:BH3+   -->   --L:BH3+  (covalent bond)
#  --L:BH3+ (covalent)  --> --L:BH3+  (both held-up)

##### (3)
## parte 3 - " and the pore-forming proteins by mutual sequestration (T'd arrows)."
# (3)(a) anti-apoptotic (--L) bind to B++
#    (b) --L and B++ are held up from further action
#  --L + B++  <--> --L:B++  (reversible binding, noncovalent?)
#  --L:B++   -->   --L:B++  (covalent bond)
#  --L:B++ (covalent)  --> --L:B++  (both held-up)

##### (4)
## parte 4 - "The sensitizer BH3-only proteins (e.g. BAD, NOXA) bind to and inhibit the anti-apoptotic
## proteins also by mutual sequestration."
# (4)(a) BH3+ bind to --L
#    (b) --L and BH3+ are held up from further action
#  BH3+ + --L   <-->  BH3+:--L    (reversible binding, noncovalent?)
#  BH3+:--L (covalent bound) -->  BH3+:--L  (inactive --L)

##### (5)
## parte 5 - "Recruitment of the complexes to the membrane by *constitutive* interactions (e.g. BAK)
## [...] increases the affinities and local concentrations and reduces the diffusion of the BCL-2 family proteins."
# - constitutive - never stops, always ready


##### (6)
## parte 6 - "Recruitment of the complexes to the membrane by [...] *dynamic* interactions (e.g. BAX, BID, BIM)
## increases the affinities and local concentrations and reduces the diffusion of the BCL-2 family proteins."


##### (7)  ---------AMBIGUOUS-----------
## parte 7 - "Localization at different intracellular membranes also dictates the binding equilibria between
## each family member."
# (7) Depending on the respective "intracellular membrane" location (which membrane, or, which location within
#      a membrane?), depending, the two (? - ambiguous) species have varying binding equilibria-tendencies.


##### (8)
## parte 8 - "The efficiency of inhibition by mutual sequestration of anti-apoptotic proteins depends on both
## affinities and off-rates of the interactions."


##### (9)
## parte 9 - "Interaction of the BH4 region of the anti-apoptotic proteins with BAX shifts the BAX-membrane
##  binding equilibrium to favor the unbound state (retrotranslocation, not shown.)
